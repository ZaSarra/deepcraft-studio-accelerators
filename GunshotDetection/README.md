# Gunshot Detection

## Overview

This is a starter model for detecting gunshots in a noisy environment, quite far along in its development. The model includes strong invariance to many different background noises with around 1 hour of microphone data.
It is presented here with the purpose of being supplemented with a significant amount of gunshot data, without having to worry as much about recording and adding background noise data. 

## Collection of Data
The data was collected by downloading Creative Commons licensed audio files from freesounds.org.

## Adding More Data
In order to add more data, you need to upload 48000 Hz audio files with appropriate labels. This could be done either by finding more data online or recording audio using a microphone, such as the AI Evaluation Kit (https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s2-ai/). 
Regardless of how the data is obtained, it can be labelled in DEEPCRAFT Studio.
The primary goal should be to add more gunshot audio files, since the existing dataset is lacking in that regard.
The practical and legal concerns for collecting gunshot data are unfortunately unavoidable and outside of our expertise to advise on; however, they are likely necessary to produce a production-ready model.

## Steps to Production
The recommended path to production begins with identifying the use case and tailoring this starter model to that need. 
This involves identifying the intended environment since a model trained on indoor ballistics will have a different performance than one trained in a field or in the woods. 
The most important step is adding relevant gunshot data to the model, after which the details of how the model can be tested need to be tackled. Due to the nature of this model, there is a large gap between creating a proof of concept and implementing an actual production-ready model.
When testing the model, it is possible that gunshot sounds played through a speaker will not be detected, but real gunshots will. This is desired for most applications but an annoyance in testing and demoing of the model. 
To deal with this, it is recommended to branch off and create a new 'demo' model that has been supplemented with data of gunshot sounds played through a speaker.
