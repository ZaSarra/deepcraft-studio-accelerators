# Data folder

Folder where to put data of the project.

Suggestions:

- place each dataset/recording in its own folder, including label files, videos of data collection, metadata, etc.
- give the same name to each data file in each folder, e.g. data.data, data.wav, etc.
- group folders with data from same class or characteristic. For instance, person1 contains folders gestures1, gestures2, etc. and each gesture folder contains folders with actual data
